=== HOW TO GENERATE PASSWORD? ===

to achive less predictable password you need string which is opposite
to what jack ripper tool would like you to use.  You can think in 
opose direction to find the strongest method to create strong password.

it has to be long otherwise there is not going to be many variations if 
you say use only 3 characters for your password. ATM 16 chars and longer
are recomended.

your passwords should vary in length.  if length of password is predicted
it becomes trivial to break.

it needs to contain both capital and small characters and numerical chars.
do not use only capped or only small letter subset.  it is first tried to 
use only small letters and breaking passwords like this takes much less 
time then these constracted from larger set of chars.

add some extra characters ie space dollar percent +- etc to make pull of 
available chars longer.  frequently attacks are only successful on 
alphanumeric passwords without special chars.

do not use the same password in more then one service.  if one gets 
compromised all other services will get rabbed as well.

never copy it from online services or allow someone else to do your password.
